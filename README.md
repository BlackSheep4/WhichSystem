# WhichSystem
WhichSystem will identify the operating system a server uses based on the TTL of an ICMP ping

## How to use
WhichSystem is really simple. Just enter the IP of your target, or domain destination and wait a few seconds. Later, based on the TTL of a simple ICMP ping, the program will let you know what type of operating system is using your target.
